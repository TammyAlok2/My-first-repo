    <p style="font-size: 130%;">
      Machu Pichu is a great representation of the Incan way of life. The
      positions of important structures in Machu Pichu were <br />
      influenced by the location of nearby mountains regarded as holy by the
      Inca people. No mortar was used to build the structures <br />
      in Machu Pichu.The stones were cut and wedged in a manner that even a
      credit card would not go through the joints. While <br />
      it definitely improved the aesthetic value of the buildings, it also
      protected from earthquakes. The stones would 'dance' <br />if there were
      earthquakes and then fall back into place once the tremors subsided.
